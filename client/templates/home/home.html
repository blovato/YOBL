            Truly knowing your Bible through the practice of reading your Bible has become a lost art, and it seems we are becoming illiterate when it comes to the Bible. We believe the Scriptures are Godâ€™s self-revelation and self-disclosure; therefore, knowing and responding to Scripture is vastly important. The Year of Biblical Literacy is a collaborative project between The Bible Project, Bridgetown Church, and Reality SF to teach a new generation to know and love the Scriptures.
